-Implemented face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade, achieving efficient and real-time face localization.
-Developed a face recognition system with OpenCV's LBPH, ensuring reliable identification across different conditions.
-Leveraged OpenCV for image preprocessing, including grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and resizing.
-Utilized OpenCV for real-time video processing, enabling continuous face detection and recognition in live streams.
-Integrated OpenCV with OS and NumPy for seamless data handling, optimizing image loading and storage operations.
-Automated dataset management by using OS to create a 'faces' directory, efficiently storing detected face images for training and recognition.
-Designed an interactive OpenCV-based system for face detection and recognition, making it user-friendly and adaptable
